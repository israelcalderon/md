# Requirements
Pyhon >= 3.9

This program was created using python standar libraries so there is no need to install any external library

# Run the program
This is for Unix like OS:
```python3
python3 src/main.py
```

Introduce the amount of Pythagorean triplets you want in the prompt and hit enter

## Notes
If you enter a big amount of triplets probably your terminal will not be able to show all the results, in that case run the script passing the triplets amount as a position argument and store the results in a text file, for instance:

```python3
python3 src/main.py 100000 > triplets.txt
```
